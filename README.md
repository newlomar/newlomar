# Hi!

I've choiced to do this README in english because I wanted it to be understandable for the maximum possible number of people.

Creating solutions and solving problems is what I like to do.

I'm currently working as Configuration and Change Management Analyst | DevOps at <a href="https://somos.us" target="_blank">Somos</a>. My job is basically resolving any system problem of the company.

I try to code everyday, because I like it and it helps me to think and resolve problems, that are not always only code related, when they appears (every day).

I am also AWS Certified:

[AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/2351bdbe-b8bd-408f-a2f3-45f878267b23/public_url)
