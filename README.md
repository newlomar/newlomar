# Hi!

I'm a Brazilian tech person that can also be called developer sometimes. I've choiced to do this README in english because I wanted it to be understandable for the maximum possible number of people.

My life goal is to help people as much as I can. Right now I'm helping myself to be able to help more people in the future, but I do some social activities to help the ones who most need.

If I can help you with something, just let me know. My twitter is at this profile.

Creating solutions and solving problems is what I like to do.

I'm currently working as Configuration and Change Management Analyst | DevOps at <a href="https://somos.us" target="_blank">Somos</a>. My job is basically resolving any system (and routine related system) problems of the company.

I try to code everyday, because I like it and it helps me to think and resolve problems (not only code related) when they appears (every day).

I am also AWS Certified:
