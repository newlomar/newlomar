# Hi!

I'm a Brazilian tech person that can also be called developer sometimes. I've choiced to do this README in english because I decided to make it understandable for the maximum possible number of people.

My life goal is to help people as much as I can. Right now I'm helping myself to be able to help more people in the future, but I do some social activities to help the ones who most need.

Creating solutions and solving problems is what I like to do.

I'm currently working as Configuration and Change Management Analyst | DevOps at [Somos](https://somos.us). My job is basically resolving any systems (and routine related systems) problems of the company. Security has been one of the major, if not *THE* major responsability of mine in the last few months, so I'm also always trying to understand a bit more about this subject every day. I really apreciate to be able to garantee that every person in contact with something that I work with can be relaxed and sure that is secured, as maximum as possible.

I also try to code everyday, because I like it and it helps me to think in solutions not only related to code.

I am also AWS Certified:
